# CoreOS Community Code Of Conduct

## Short form

The CoreOS community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, neuro(a)typicality, body size, race, age, or religion. We do not condone any statements by speakers contrary to these standards.  We do not tolerate harassment of attendees in any form. Violators of these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at any time at the discretion of the meetup organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at: https://github.com/coreos/community/blob/master/codeofconduct.md

## Long form

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.  

- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment. 
 
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.  

- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.  

- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, a hug or back rub) without consent or after a request to stop.  

- Threats of violence.  

- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.  

- Deliberate intimidation.  

- Stalking or following.  

- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.  

- Sustained disruption of discussion.  

- Unwelcome sexual attention.  

- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others. 

- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.  

- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.  

- Publication of non-harassing private communication.  

We recognize the potential for this reporting system to be used as a form of abuse, itself. In order to protect volunteers from abusers, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. 
The decision to reject a report will always be made by consensus of more than one event organizer or staff. The rejection will be recorded like a normal report, so we can track potential manipulation or exploitation of this rule.  
  

**Enforcement**

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Speakers and sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualized images, activities, or other harassing material.
 
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.


**Reporting**

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. 

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.
 

**Anonymous Report**

You can make an anonymous report here: https://goo.gl/forms/4MxVOs8rkGSrC3Z12. After you submit your report, organizers will be immediately notified. Organizers will do their best to respond in a timely manner (within an hour).

We can't follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.


**Personal Report**

You can make a personal report by contacting an event organizer. When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may ask if it’s ok to involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. It is acceptable to say no. 

Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and we won't tell anyone who you are.

Our team will assist you in contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. 


**Steps to respond to a report**

When we receive an abuse complaint, these are the steps we go through.
1. Remove the person(s) reporting the incident from the situation. This may not be possible for anonymous reports. We suggest anonymous reporters to remove themselves, if it’s possible.  

2. Because other event staff may be better equipped to respond to incidents the reporting individuals will be asked if they’re comfortable having another staff person present.  

3. We will ask the reporting individual if they have a friend, or other attendee at the event that they would prefer to be present (if it makes them feel safer, or provides additional info).  

4. We will write down the reported abuse, and review with the events team sometime after the event. This helps us identify repeat offenders or violators of our CoC. This report is confidential, and will only be used internally. A summary of the report, munged of personally identifying information may appear publicly, at a later time.  
Eg “Steve repeatedly used racist epithets in a conversation” may be listed just as “Abusive language incident” on a public facing record. 
 
5. We will ask the offender to cease the offending activity immediately. If we believe they are being disingenuous or otherwise subversive, they may be asked to leave.  

6. We will never physically force someone to leave. If an attendee is asked to leave, and refuses, we will contact building management and then escalate to local law enforcement as necessary.  

7. The following event after an incident should have 5 minutes dedicated to the discussion of this policy and/or the occurrence, to remind everyone that rules will be enforced.  


This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki, created by the Geek Feminism community. [http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment)
